# Home Automation 🏡
Welcome to my home automation repository !

Here you will find various automations I use everyday in my own house !

## How to use 🔌

To implement it in your home, you'll have to [install Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/) and follow [these instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/using_blueprints/#importing-blueprints) for installing blueprints

* Some of my automations require **sensors**. If so, you will find a **sensors.md** file in the same directory. It will guide you on how to add them either through the UI or in your own configuration.yaml file

* Sometimes, the automations will not be available through **blueprints**. If so, open the **automation.yaml** file and adapt it for your own config !

* Finally, my automations could include optional **extra elements** (dashboards, esphome sensors, small automations, etc...), located in the **"Extra"** folder
