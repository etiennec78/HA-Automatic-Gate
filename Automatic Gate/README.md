# Automatic Gate ‚õ©Ô∏è
## Description üìù
**Modular** and **secure** gate automation that **opens your gate** upon leaving or arriving
* Supports up to 10 users driving **simultaneously**
* Manual override : Prioritizes manual actions over the automation, letting you control your gate even while the automation is running
* Security features : Auto-close timer, alert notifications, timeout detection, aborting on vehicle left, aborting if driven near home without entering, keeping gate open while someone else approaches or leaves home
* Various options : Custom gate settings, iBeacon automatic closing, travel time update interval
