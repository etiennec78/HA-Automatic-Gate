### Install as an automation ü§ñ
Not recommended üôÖ
1. Rename each 'user0', 'user1' and 'user2' to the person ids of each of your users.
2. Rename all your sensors id so they contain these names like in the automation (e.g : notify.mobile_app_user0_phone ) (Settings > Devices > Entities > select an entity > Settings > change their id)
3. Either copy the automation to your automations folder or simply copy and paste the code in a new automation with the UI
