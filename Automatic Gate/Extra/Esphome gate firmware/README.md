# Esphome Gate Firmware ⚙️

## Description

An [ESP32](https://amzn.to/3y2UtCr) firmware I use to **smartify** my FAAC [E024S](https://faac.fr/Docs/Documentations%20techniques/13%20PLATINE_ELECTRONIQUE/E024S/RevE/E024S_732642RevE_FR.pdf) **gate**

Supports the following features :

* Only accepting open requests when someone is nearer than **1km from home** 📏
* Only accepting requests when **ready**, to avoid double presses which would make it report the wrong state ✅
* Only using **one pin**, to only use one relay and work by **guessing** the actual state of the gate 💡
* Opening and closing **even while moving**, by sending a double pulse, and inverting time taken to move to the current position 🔄
* **Error reporting** in HA, to see why the gate decided not to move ⛔
* **BLE scanner**, with automatically turns entity status to unavailable after no signal for 25s 📡
* **BLE switch**, which allows you to **turn off** the continuous BLE scanning ⏻

## How to install 🚀

### Prerequisites 🏁

1. An [ESP32 with relay](https://amzn.to/3y2UtCr)
2. [ESPHome installed](https://esphome.io/guides/installing_esphome.html)
3. Your gate documentation to identify the gate opening/closing pin
4. Your ESP32 documentation to identify the pin used for the relay ([this model](https://amzn.to/3y2UtCr) uses GPIO16 and GPIO17)
5. Home Assistant sensors : [Persons](https://github.com/etiennec78/Home-Automation/blob/master/Automatic%20Gate/sensors.md#gps-location-trackers-), [Proximity sensors](https://github.com/etiennec78/Home-Automation/blob/master/Automatic%20Gate/sensors.md#proximity-sensors-), [Notify group](https://github.com/etiennec78/Home-Automation/blob/master/Automatic%20Gate/sensors.md#notify-all-devices-group-), optional : [phone iBeacons UUIDs](https://github.com/etiennec78/Home-Automation/blob/master/Automatic%20Gate/sensors.md#bluetooth-transmitter-)

### Steps 📜

1. Clone this repo
    * Run : `git clone https://github.com/etiennec78/Home-Automation.git`
2. Edit [the file](gate.yaml) to fill your needs
    * Change the GPIO pin
    * Replace any "!secret" line with your own information
    * Adapt the gate moving time (default 42s)
3. Flash your ESP32
    * Plug it into your computer
    * Run : `python -m esphome run gate.yaml`
4. Harware connections
    * Run a cable between your gate opening/closing pin and your ESP32 relay pin
    * Either power your ESP32 with a gate pin, or an external supply
5. Connect your ESP32 to Home Assistant
    * Home Assistant should detect your ESPHome device automatically on your LAN
    * Connect it and enter your api_key
    * Finally, go to *[Settings > Devices & services > ESPHome](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=esphome) > three-dot menu to the right of your gate > Configure > Allow the device to make Home Assistant service calls ✔*
